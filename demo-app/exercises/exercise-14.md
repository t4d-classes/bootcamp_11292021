# Exercise 14

1. Using the sorted list hook, add column sorting to the Car Tool. Use a button in each TH element to sort on the following columns: id, make, model, year, color, and price. The first click of a column header button sorts ascending. The second click sorts descending. The table should always be properly sorted.

2. Ensure all Car Tool functionality continues to work.
