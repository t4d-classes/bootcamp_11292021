# Exercise 19

1. Add a button with a label of "Clear". When the clear button is clicked, set the result to 0.

2. Display a history of calc operations beneath the buttons. Each time the add, subtract, multiply or divide buttons are clicked, an entry in the history should be displayed.

3. Each history entry should display the operation performed, and the value typed in the input box when the operation performed. Do not display a running result.

4. When the clear button is clicked, clear the history as well.

5. Ensure it works!
