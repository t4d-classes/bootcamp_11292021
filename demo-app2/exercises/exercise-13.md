# Exercise 13

1. If Color Tool is not use the `useList` hook. Please update it to use the `useList`.

1. Add a delete button to each item in the color list component. When the delete button is clicked, remove the item from the list.

1. Add a sort button to the Color Tool application. When the list is first displayed, show the colors in id order. When the button is clicked, sort the colors by name ascending. When the button is clicked again, sort the colors by name descending. When the button is clicked again, display in id order. On the button text, display the current sort order in some meaningful way. No matter what, the colors should be sorted according to the current sort setting.

Note: Please do not manage the sorting inside of useList.

1. Ensure all functionality of the Color Tool application continues to work.
