# Exercise 14

1. Using the sorted list hook, add column sorting to the Car Tool. Use a button in each TH element to sort on the following columns: id, make, model, year, color, and price. The first click of a column header button sorts ascending. The second click sorts descending. The table should always be properly sorted.

1. Update the button text to show the column being sorted and the sort direction.

1. Ensure all Car Tool functionality continues to work.
